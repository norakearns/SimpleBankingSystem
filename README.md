# SimpleBankingSystem
Project Idea: Develop a basic banking system that allows users to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check balances. Each user account can be an object.

Why Itâ€™s Great for Beginners: This project introduces you to the idea of encapsulation, where you hide the internal details of an object and expose only the necessary methods.
